//! WebTransport is a protocol for client-server communication over QUIC.
//! It's [available in the browser](https://caniuse.com/webtransport) as an alternative to HTTP and WebSockets.
//!
//! WebTransport is layered on top of HTTP/3 which is then layered on top of QUIC.
//! This library hides that detail and tries to expose only the QUIC API, delegating as much as possible to the underlying implementation.
//! See the [Quinn documentation](https://docs.rs/quinn/latest/quinn/) for more documentation.
//!
//! QUIC provides two primary APIs:
//!
//! # Streams
//! QUIC streams are ordered, reliable, flow-controlled, and optionally bidirectional.
//! Both endpoints can create and close streams (including an error code) with no overhead.
//! You can think of them as TCP connections, but shared over a single QUIC connection.
//!
//! # Datagrams
//! QUIC datagrams are unordered, unreliable, and not flow-controlled.
//! Both endpoints can send datagrams below the MTU size (~1.2kb minimum) and they might arrive out of order or not at all.
//! They are basically UDP packets, except they are encrypted and congestion controlled.
//!
//! # Limitations
//! WebTransport is able to be pooled with HTTP/3 and multiple WebTransport sessions.
//! This crate avoids that complexity, doing the bare minimum to support a single WebTransport session that owns the entire QUIC connection.
//! If you want to support HTTP/3 on the same host/port, you should use another crate (ex. `h3-webtransport`).
//! If you want to support multiple WebTransport sessions over the same QUIC connection... you should just dial a new QUIC connection instead.
